# Payday 2 Solo Achievements
[Payday 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/PAYDAY_2/) [BLT](https://github.com/JamesWilko/Payday-2-BLT) cheat mod that allows to solo achievements and trophies that require more than one human player.

For achievements and trophies that required 2 or 4 human players, this number is reduced to 1. Other requirements still apply for every human player. Achievements and trophies affected:
* Here Comes the Pain Train
* Cooking With Style
* Boston Saints
* Heisters of the Round Table
* Original Heisters
* Mercenary trophy
* Scrap Metal trophy
* Reputation Beyond Reproach
* 120 Proof

For achievements that required 4 different masks, this number now scales with number of players - for solo play 1 mask is required, for 2 players 2 different masks, for 3 players 3 and so on. Bots do not count. Achievements affected:
* Reindeer Games
* Ghost Riders
* Funding Father
* Four Monkeys
* Sounds of Animals Fighting
* Unusual Suspects
* Wind of Change
* Riders On the Snowstorm
* Honor Among Thieves

Other achievements and trophies:
* Long Fellow trophy - added a mod option that increases forklift capacity to 8 bags to be possible to transport everything in one go, switched off by default because only 3 bags are visible either way
* OVERDRILL	- added a mod key bind that activates the Overdrill mode ([source](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/payday-2-a/160411-overdrill-vault-activator.html))
* Megalo-Mania - reduced amount of combined stacks required to 390 for 1, 780 for 2 and 1170 for 3 players

Achievements that I did not found a way to mod:
* Sewer Rats (charliesierra_1) - might be doable with [Iter](http://paydaymods.com/mods/433/ITR) + [Keepers](http://paydaymods.com/mods/102/KPR) + [Monkeepers](http://paydaymods.com/mods/581/MKP)
* Short Fuse (short_fuse)
* Pass the Ammo (spa_6)

Achievements and trophies not affected by this mod:
